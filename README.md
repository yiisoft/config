This [Composer] plugin provides assembling
of configurations distributed with composer packages.
It allows putting configuration needed to use a package right inside of
the package thus implementing a plugin system. The package becomes a plugin
holding both the code and its configuration.

## Installation

```sh
composer require "yiisoft/config"
```

## How it works?

The package consist of two parts: Composer plugin and config loader.

After composer updates its autoload file, and that happens after `dump-autoload`, `require`, `update` or `remove`,
Composer plugin:

- Scans installed packages for `config-plugin` extra option in their
  `composer.json`.
- Copies missing config files into the project `configs`.
- Writes build plan into `/config/packages/package_options.php`.
  
In the application entry point, usually `index.php`, we create an instance of config loader and require a configuration
we need:

```php
$config = new \Yiisoft\Config\Config(dirname(__DIR__));
$webConfig = $config->get('web');
```

## Config groups

List your config files in `composer.json` like the following:

```json
"extra": {
    "config-plugin-output-dir": "path/relative-to-composer-json", // not supported yet
    "config-plugin": {
        "envs": "db.env",
        "params": [
            "config/params.php",
            "?config/params-local.php"
        ],
        "common": "config/common.php",
        "web": [
            "$common",
            "config/web.php",
            "../src/Modules/*/config/web.php"
        ],
        "other": "config/other.php"
    }
},
```

### Markers 

- `?` - marks optional files. Absence of files not marked with it will cause exception.
    ```
    "params": [
       "params.php",
       "?params-local.php"
    ]
    ```
  It's okay if `params-local.php` will not found, but it's not okay if `params.php` will be absent.
  
- `*` - marks wildcard path. It means zero or more matches by wildcard mask.
  ```
  "web": [
     "../src/Modules/*/config/web.php"
  ]
  ```
  It will collect all `web.php` in any subfolders of `src/Modules/` in `config` folder.

- `$` - reference to another config.
  ```
  "params": [
     "params.php",
     "?params-local.php"
  ],
  "params-console": [
     "$params",
     "params-console.php"
  ],
  "params-web": [
     "$params",
     "params-web.php"
  ]
  ```
  Output files `params-console.php` and `params-web.php` will contain `params.php` and `params-local.php`.

***

Define your configs like the following:

```php
<?php

return [
    'components' => [
        'db' => [
            'class' => \my\Db::class,
            'name' => $params['db.name'],
            'password' => $params['db.password'],
        ],
    ],
];
```

A special variable `$params` is read from `params` config.


### Using sub-configs

In order to access a sub-config, use the following in your config:

```php
'routes' => $config->get('routes');
```
