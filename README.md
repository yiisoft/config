This [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) plugin provides assembling of configurations distributed with composer
packages. It allows putting configuration needed to use a package right inside thus implementing
a plugin system. The package becomes a plugin holding both the code and its configuration.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or higher.
- `JSON` PHP extension.
- Composer 2.0 or higher.

## Installation

```shell
composer require yiisoft/config --prefer-dist
```

## How it works?

The package consist of two parts: Composer plugin and config loader.

After composer updates its autoload file, and that happens after `dump-autoload`, `require`, `update` or `remove`,
Composer plugin:

- Scans installed packages for `config-plugin` extra option in their `composer.json`.
- Copies missing config files into the project `configs`.
- Writes a merge plan into `config/packages/merge_plan.php`. It includes configuration from each package `composer.json`.
- Tracks change to configuration files from the vendor by storing metadata in the `config/packages/dist.lock` file.
- In the interactive console mode it asks what to do with modified configs after updating packages in the vendor.
  
In the application entry point, usually `index.php`, we create an instance of config loader and require a configuration
we need:

```php
$config = new \Yiisoft\Config\Config(dirname(__DIR__));
$webConfig = $config->get('web');
```

The `web` in the above is a config group. The config loader obtains it runtime according to the merge plan.

## Config groups

Each config group represents a set of configs that is merged into a single array. It is defined per package in
each package `composer.json`:

```json
"extra": {
    "config-plugin": {
        "params": [
            "config/params.php",
            "?config/params-local.php"
        ],
        "common": "config/common.php",
        "web": [
            "$common",
            "config/web.php",
            "../src/Modules/*/config/web.php"
        ],
        "other": "config/other.php"
    }
},
```

### Markers 

- `?` - marks optional files. Absence of files not marked with it will cause exception.
    ```
    "params": [
       "params.php",
       "?params-local.php"
    ]
    ```
  It's okay if `params-local.php` will not found, but it's not okay if `params.php` will be absent.
  
- `*` - marks wildcard path. It means zero or more matches by wildcard mask.
  ```
  "web": [
     "../src/Modules/*/config/web.php"
  ]
  ```
  It will collect all `web.php` in any sub-folders of `src/Modules/` in `config` folder.

- `$` - reference to another config.
  ```
  "params": [
     "params.php",
     "?params-local.php"
  ],
  "params-console": [
     "$params",
     "params-console.php"
  ],
  "params-web": [
     "$params",
     "params-web.php"
  ]
  ```
  Output files `params-console.php` and `params-web.php` will contain `params.php` and `params-local.php`.

***

Define your configs like the following:

```php
<?php

return [
    'components' => [
        'db' => [
            'class' => \my\Db::class,
            'name' => $params['db.name'],
            'password' => $params['db.password'],
        ],
    ],
];
```

A special variable `$params` is read from `params` config.

### Using sub-configs

In order to access a sub-config, use the following in your config:

```php
'routes' => $config->get('routes');
```

## Options

A number of options is available both for Composer plugin and a config loader. Composer options are specified in
`composer.json`:

```json
"extra": {
    "config-plugin-options": {
      "output-directory": "/config/packages",
      "source-directory": "/config",
    },
    "config-plugin": {
        // ...
    },

},
```

In the above `output-directory` points to where configs will be copied to. The path is relative to where
`composer.json` is. The option is read for the root package, which is typically an application.
Default is "/config/packages".

If you change output directory, don't forget to adjust configs path when creating an instance of `Config`. Usually
that is `index.php`:

```php
$config = new \Yiisoft\Config\Config(
    dirname(__DIR__),
    '/config/packages', // Configs path.
);

$webConfig = $config->get('web');
```

`source-directory` points to where to read configs from for the package the option is specified for. The option is
read for all packages. The value is a path relative to where package `composer.json` is. Default value is empty string.

## Recursive merge 

By default, no configs are merged recursively, except for `params.php`, `events.php`, `events-console.php`,
`events-web.php`. If you want to merge some configs recursively you must pass their names to `Config` constructor:

```php
$config = new \Yiisoft\Config\Config(
    dirname(__DIR__),
    '/config/packages',
    'dev',
    ['modules.php'],
);

$appConfig = $config->get('modules'); // merged recursively
```

## Environments

The plugin supports creating additional environments added to the base configuration. This allows you to create
multiple configurations for the application such as `production` and `development`.

> The environment configuration options are added to the main configuration options, but do not replace them.

The environments are specified in the `composer.json` file of your application:

```json
"extra": {
    "config-plugin": {
        "params": "config/params.php",
        "web": "config/web.php",
    },
    "config-plugin-environments": {
        "dev": {
            "params": "config/dev/params.php",
            "app": [
                "$web",
                "config/dev/app.php"
            ]
        },
        "prod": {
            "app": "config/prod/app.php"
        }
    }
},
```

Configuration defines the merge process. One of the environments from `config-plugin-environments`
is merged with the main configuration defined by `config-plugin`. In given example, in the `dev` environment
we use `$web` configuration from the main environment.

This configuration has the following structure:

```
config/             Configuration root directory.
    dev/            Development environment files.
        app.php     Development environment app group configuration.
        params.php  Development environment parameters.
    prod/           Production environment files.
        app.php     Production environment app group configuration.
    params.php      Main configuration parameters.
    web.php         Ðœain configuration web group configuration.
```

To choose an environent to be used you must specify its name when creating an instance of `Config`:

```php
$config = new \Yiisoft\Config\Config(
    dirname(__DIR__),
    '/config/packages',
    [],
    'dev',
);

$appConfig = $config->get('app');
```

If defined in an environment, `params` will be merged with `params` from the main configuration,
and could be used as `$params` in all configurations.

## Commands

The plugin adds extra `config-diff`command to composer. It displays the difference between the vendor and application
configuration files in the console.

```shell
# For all config files
composer config-diff

# For the config files of the specified packages
composer config-diff yiisoft/aliases yiisoft/view
```
